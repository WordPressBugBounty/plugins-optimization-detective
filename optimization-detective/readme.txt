Provides an API for leveraging real user metrics to detect optimizations to apply on the frontend to improve page performance.

== Description ==

This plugin captures real user metrics about what elements are displayed on the page across a variety of device form factors (e.g. desktop, tablet, and phone) in order to apply loading optimizations which are not possible with WordPress‚Äôs current server-side heuristics.

This plugin is a dependency which does not provide end-user functionality on its own. For that, please install the dependent plugin [Image Prioritizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-prioritizer/) or [Embed Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-optimizer/) (among [others](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/labels/%5BPlugin%5D%20Optimization%20Detective) to come from the WordPress Core Performance team).

= Background =

WordPress uses [server-side heuristics](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/13/image-performance-enhancements-in-wordpress-6-3/) to make educated guesses about which images are likely to be in the initial viewport. Likewise, it uses server-side heuristics to identify a hero image which is likely to be the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. To optimize page loading, it avoids lazy loading any of these images while also adding `fetchpriority=high` to the hero image. When these heuristics are applied successfully, the LCP metric for page loading can be improved 5-10%. Unfortunately, however, there are limitations to the heuristics that make the correct identification of which image is the LCP element only about 50% effective. See [Analyzing the Core Web Vitals performance impact of WordPress 6.3 in the field](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/19/analyzing-the-core-web-vitals-performance-impact-of-wordpress-6-3-in-the-field/). For example, it is [common](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/pull/73) for the LCP element to vary between different viewport widths, such as desktop versus mobile. Since WordPress's heuristics are completely server-side it has no knowledge of how the page is actually laid out, and it cannot prioritize loading of images according to the client's viewport width.

In order to increase the accuracy of identifying the LCP element, including across various client viewport widths, this plugin gathers metrics from real users (RUM) to detect the actual LCP element and then use this information to optimize the page for future visitors so that the loading of the LCP element is properly prioritized. This is the purpose of Optimization Detective. The approach is heavily inspired by Philip Walton‚Äôs [Dynamic LCP Priority: Learning from Past Visits](https://philipwalton.com/articles/dynamic-lcp-priority/). See also the initial exploration document that laid out this project: [Image Loading Optimization via Client-side Detection](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/16qAJ7I_ljhEdx2Cn2VlK7IkiixobY9zNn8FXxN9T9Ls/view).

= Technical Foundation =

At the core of Optimization Detective is the ‚ÄúURL Metric‚Äù, information about a page according to how it was loaded by a client with a specific viewport width. This includes which elements were visible in the initial viewport and which one was the LCP element. The URL Metric data is also extensible. Each URL on a site can have an associated set of these URL Metrics (stored in a custom post type) which are gathered from the visits of real users. It gathers samples of URL Metrics which are grouped according to WordPress's default responsive breakpoints:

1. Mobile: 0-480px
2. Phablet: 481-600px
3. Tablet: 601-782px
4. Desktop: \>782px

When no more URL Metrics are needed for a URL due to the sample size being obtained for the viewport group, it discontinues serving the JavaScript to gather the metrics (leveraging the [web-vitals.js](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) library). With the URL Metrics in hand, the output-buffered page is sent through the HTML Tag Processor and--when the [Image Prioritizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-prioritizer/) dependent plugin is installed--the images which were the LCP element for various breakpoints will get prioritized with high-priority preload links (along with `fetchpriority=high` on the actual `img` tag when it is the common LCP element across all breakpoints). LCP elements with background images added via inline `background-image` styles are also prioritized with preload links.

URL Metrics have a ‚Äúfreshness TTL‚Äù after which they will be stale and the JavaScript will be served again to start gathering metrics again to ensure that the right elements continue to get their loading prioritized. When a URL Metrics custom post type hasn't been touched in a while, it is automatically garbage-collected.

üëâ **Note:** This plugin optimizes pages for actual visitors, and it depends on visitors to optimize pages (since URL Metrics need to be collected). As such, you won't see optimizations applied immediately after activating the plugin (and dependent plugin(s)). And since administrator users are not normal visitors typically, optimizations are not applied for admins by default (but this can be overridden with the `od_can_optimize_response` filter below). URL Metrics are not collected for administrators because it is likely that additional elements will be present on the page which are not also shown to non-administrators, meaning the URL Metrics could not reliably be reused between them.

There are currently **no settings** and no user interface for this plugin since it is designed to work without any configuration.

When the `WP_DEBUG` constant is enabled, additional logging for Optimization Detective is added to the browser console.

= Use Cases and Examples =

As mentioned above, this plugin is a dependency that doesn't provide features on its own. Dependent plugins leverage the collected URL Metrics to apply optimizations. What follows us a running list of the optimizations which are enabled by Optimization Detective, along with a links to the related code used for the implementation:

**[Image Prioritizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-prioritizer/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/tree/trunk/plugins/image-prioritizer)):**

1. Add breakpoint-specific `fetchpriority=high` preload links (`LINK[rel=preload]`) for image URLs of LCP elements:
   1. An `IMG` element, including the `srcset`/`sizes` attributes supplied as `imagesrcset`/`imagesizes` on the `LINK`. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L167-L177), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L304-L349))
   2. The first `SOURCE` element with a `type` attribute in a `PICTURE` element. (Art-directed `PICTURE` elements using media queries are not supported.) ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L192-L275), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L304-L349))
   3. An element with a CSS `background-image` inline `style` attribute. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-background-image-styled-tag-visitor.php#L62-L92), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-background-image-styled-tag-visitor.php#L182-L203))
   4. An element with a CSS `background-image` applied with a stylesheet (when the image is from an allowed origin). ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/hooks.php#L14-L16), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-background-image-styled-tag-visitor.php#L82-L83), [3](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-background-image-styled-tag-visitor.php#L135-L203), [4](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/helper.php#L83-L320), [5](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/detect.js))
   5. A `VIDEO` element's `poster` image. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-video-tag-visitor.php#L127-L161))
2. Ensure `fetchpriority=high` is only added to an `IMG` when it is the LCP element across all responsive breakpoints. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L65-L91), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L137-L146))
3. Add `fetchpriority=low` to `IMG` tags which appear in the initial viewport but are not visible, such as when they are subsequent carousel slides. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L105-L123), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L137-L146))
4. Lazy loading:
   1. Apply lazy loading to `IMG` tags based on whether they appear in any breakpoint‚Äôs initial viewport. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L124-L133))
   2. Implement lazy loading of CSS background images added via inline `style` attributes. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-background-image-styled-tag-visitor.php#L205-L238), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/helper.php#L365-L380), [3](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/lazy-load-bg-image.js))
   3. Lazy-load `VIDEO` tags by setting the appropriate attributes based on whether they appear in the initial viewport. If a `VIDEO` is the LCP element, it gets `preload=auto`; if it is in an initial viewport, the `preload=metadata` default is left; if it is not in an initial viewport, it gets `preload=none`. Lazy-loaded videos also get initial `preload`, `autoplay`, and `poster` attributes restored when the `VIDEO` is going to enter the viewport. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-video-tag-visitor.php#L163-L246), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/helper.php#L365-L380), [3](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/lazy-load-video.js))
5. Ensure that [`sizes=auto`](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/18/auto-sizes-for-lazy-loaded-images-in-wordpress-6-7/) is added to all lazy-loaded `IMG` elements. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-img-tag-visitor.php#L148-L163))
6. Reduce the size of the `poster` image of a `VIDEO` from full size to the size appropriate for the maximum width of the video (on desktop). ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/image-prioritizer/class-image-prioritizer-video-tag-visitor.php#L84-L125))

**[Embed Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-optimizer/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/tree/trunk/plugins/embed-optimizer)):**

1. Lazy loading embeds just before they come into view. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/embed-optimizer/class-embed-optimizer-tag-visitor.php#L191-L194), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/embed-optimizer/hooks.php#L168-L336))
2. Adding preconnect links for embeds in the initial viewport. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/embed-optimizer/class-embed-optimizer-tag-visitor.php#L114-L190))
3. Reserving space for embeds that resize to reduce layout shifting. ([1](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/embed-optimizer/hooks.php#L64-L65), [2](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/embed-optimizer/hooks.php#L81-L144), [3](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/embed-optimizer/detect.js), [4](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/f5f50f9179c26deadeef966734367d199ba6de6f/plugins/embed-optimizer/class-embed-optimizer-tag-visitor.php#L218-L285))

= Hooks =

**Action:** `od_init` (argument: plugin version)

Fires when the Optimization Detective is initializing. This action is useful for loading extension code that depends on Optimization Detective to be running. The version of the plugin is passed as the sole argument so that if the required version is not present, the callback can short circuit.

**Action:** `od_register_tag_visitors` (argument: `OD_Tag_Visitor_Registry`)

Fires to register tag visitors before walking over the document to perform optimizations.

For example, to register a new tag visitor that targets `H1` elements:

`
<?php
add_action(
	'od_register_tag_visitors',
	static function ( OD_Tag_Visitor_Registry $registry ) {
		$registry->register(
			'my-plugin/h1',
			static function ( OD_Tag_Visitor_Context $context ): bool {
				if ( $context->processor->get_tag() !== 'H1' ) {
					return false;
				}
				// Now optimize based on stored URL Metrics in $context->url_metric_group_collection.
				// ...

				// Returning true causes the tag to be tracked in URL Metrics. If there is no need
				// for this, as in there is no reference to $context->url_metric_group_collection
				// in a tag visitor, then this can instead return false.
				return true;
			}
		);
	}
);
`

Refer to [Image Prioritizer](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/tree/trunk/plugins/image-prioritizer) and [Embed Optimizer](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/tree/trunk/plugins/embed-optimizer) for real world examples of how tag visitors are used. Registered tag visitors need only be callables, so in addition to providing a closure you may provide a `callable-string` or even a class which has an `__invoke()` method.

**Filter:** `od_breakpoint_max_widths` (default: `array(480, 600, 782)`)

Filters the breakpoint max widths to group URL Metrics for various viewports. Each number represents the maximum width (inclusive) for a given breakpoint. So if there is one number, 480, then this means there will be two viewport groupings, one for 0\<=480, and another \>480. If instead there are the two breakpoints defined, 480 and 782, then this means there will be three viewport groups of URL Metrics, one for 0\<=480 (i.e. mobile), another 481\<=782 (i.e. phablet/tablet), and another \>782 (i.e. desktop).

These default breakpoints are reused from Gutenberg which appear to be used the most in media queries that affect frontend styles.

**Filter:** `od_can_optimize_response` (default: boolean condition, see below)

Filters whether the current response can be optimized. By default, detection and optimization are only performed when:

1. It‚Äôs not a search template (`is_search()`).
2. It‚Äôs not a post embed template (`is_embed()`).
3. It‚Äôs not the Customizer preview (`is_customize_preview()`)
4. It‚Äôs not the response to a `POST` request.
5. The user is not an administrator (`current_user_can( 'customize' )`), unless you're in plugin development mode (`wp_is_development_mode( 'plugin' )`).
6. There is at least one queried post on the page. This is used to facilitate the purging of page caches after a new URL Metric is stored.

To force every response to be optimized regardless of the conditions above, you can do:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'od_can_optimize_response', '__return_true' );
`

**Filter:** `od_url_metrics_breakpoint_sample_size` (default: 3)

Filters the sample size for a breakpoint's URL Metrics on a given URL. The sample size must be greater than zero. You can increase the sample size if you want better guarantees that the applied optimizations will be accurate. During development, it may be helpful to reduce the sample size to 1:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'od_url_metrics_breakpoint_sample_size', function (): int {
	return 1;
} );
`

**Filter:** `od_url_metric_storage_lock_ttl` (default: 1 minute in seconds)

Filters how long a given IP is locked from submitting another metric-storage REST API request. Filtering the TTL to zero will disable any metric storage locking. This is useful, for example, to disable locking when a user is logged-in with code like the following:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'od_metrics_storage_lock_ttl', function ( int $ttl ): int {
    return is_user_logged_in() ? 0 : $ttl;
} );
`

**Filter:** `od_url_metric_freshness_ttl` (default: 1 day in seconds)

Filters the freshness age (TTL) for a given URL Metric. The freshness TTL must be at least zero, in which it considers URL Metrics to always be stale. In practice, the value should be at least an hour. If your site content does not change frequently, you may want to increase the TTL to a week:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'od_url_metric_freshness_ttl', static function (): int {
    return WEEK_IN_SECONDS;
} );
`

During development, this can be useful to set to zero so that you don't have to wait for new URL Metrics to be requested when engineering a new optimization:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'od_url_metric_freshness_ttl', static function (): int {
    return 0;
} );
`

**Filter:** `od_minimum_viewport_aspect_ratio` (default: 0.4)

Filters the minimum allowed viewport aspect ratio for URL Metrics.

The 0.4 value is intended to accommodate the phone with the greatest known aspect ratio at 21:9 when rotated 90 degrees to 9:21 (0.429). During development when you have the DevTools console open on the right, the viewport aspect ratio will be smaller than normal. In this case, you may want to set this to 0:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'od_minimum_viewport_aspect_ratio', static function (): int {
    return 0;
} );
`

**Filter:** `od_maximum_viewport_aspect_ratio` (default: 2.5)

Filters the maximum allowed viewport aspect ratio for URL Metrics.

The 2.5 value is intended to accommodate the phone with the greatest known aspect ratio at 21:9 (2.333).

During development when you have the DevTools console open on the bottom, for example, the viewport aspect ratio will be larger than normal. In this case, you may want to increase the maximum aspect ratio:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'od_maximum_viewport_aspect_ratio', static function (): int {
	return 5;
} );
`

**Filter:** `od_template_output_buffer` (default: the HTML response)

Filters the template output buffer prior to sending to the client. This filter is added to implement [\#43258](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43258) in WordPress core.

**Filter:** `od_url_metric_schema_element_item_additional_properties` (default: empty array)

Filters additional schema properties which should be allowed for an element's item in a URL Metric.

For example to add a `resizedBoundingClientRect` property:

`
<?php
add_filter(
	'od_url_metric_schema_element_item_additional_properties',
	static function ( array $additional_properties ): array {
		$additional_properties['resizedBoundingClientRect'] = array(
			'type'       => 'object',
			'properties' => array_fill_keys(
				array(
					'width',
					'height',
					'x',
					'y',
					'top',
					'right',
					'bottom',
					'left',
				),
				array(
					'type'     => 'number',
					'required' => true,
				)
			),
		);
		return $additional_properties;
	}
);
`

See also [example usage](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/6bb8405c5c446e3b66c2bfa3ae03ba61b188bca2/plugins/embed-optimizer/hooks.php#L81-L110) in Embed Optimizer.

**Filter:** `od_url_metric_schema_root_additional_properties` (default: empty array)

Filters additional schema properties which should be allowed at the root of a URL Metric.

The usage here is the same as the previous filter, except it allows new properties to be added to the root of the URL Metric and not just to one of the object items in the `elements` property.

**Filter:** `od_extension_module_urls` (default: empty array of strings)

Filters the list of extension script module URLs to import when performing detection.

For example:

`
<?php
add_filter(
	'od_extension_module_urls',
	static function ( array $extension_module_urls ): array {
		$extension_module_urls[] = add_query_arg( 'ver', '1.0', plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) . 'detect.js' );
		return $extension_module_urls;
	}
);
`

See also [example usage](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/6bb8405c5c446e3b66c2bfa3ae03ba61b188bca2/plugins/embed-optimizer/hooks.php#L128-L144) in Embed Optimizer. Note in particular the structure of the plugin‚Äôs [detect.js](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/trunk/plugins/embed-optimizer/detect.js) script module, how it exports `initialize` and `finalize` functions which Optimization Detective then calls when the page loads and when the page unloads, at which time the URL Metric is constructed and sent to the server for storage. Refer also to the [TypeScript type definitions](https://github.com/WordPress/performance/blob/trunk/plugins/optimization-detective/types.ts).

**Filter:** `od_current_url_metrics_etag_data` (default: array with `tag_visitors` key)

Filters the data that goes into computing the current ETag for URL Metrics.

The ETag is a unique identifier that changes whenever the underlying data used to generate it changes. By default, the ETag calculation includes the names of registered tag visitors. This ensures that when a new Optimization Detective-dependent plugin is activated (like Image Prioritizer or Embed Optimizer), any existing URL Metrics are immediately considered stale. This happens because the newly registered tag visitors alter the ETag calculation, making it different from the stored ones.

When the ETag for URL Metrics in a complete viewport group no longer matches the current environment's ETag, new URL Metrics will then begin to be collected until there are no more stored URL Metrics with the old ETag. These new URL Metrics will include data relevant to the newly activated plugins and their tag visitors.

**Action:** `od_url_metric_stored` (argument: `OD_URL_Metric_Store_Request_Context`)

Fires whenever a URL Metric was successfully stored.

The supplied context object includes these properties:

* `$request`: The `WP_REST_Request` for storing the URL Metric.
* `$post_id`: The post ID for the `od_url_metric` post.
* `$url_metric`: The newly-stored URL Metric.
* `$url_metric_group`: The viewport group that the URL Metric was added to.
* `$url_metric_group_collection`: The `OD_URL_Metric_Group_Collection` instance to which the URL Metric was added.
